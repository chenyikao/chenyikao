## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a computer science master graduated from National Cheng-chi University, Taiwan. I learned Satifiability Modulo Theory for program verification and path condition program analysis techniques when I was a doctoral student. I'm currently working as a contract Java full-stack software engineer to find their best practices.

I'm proficient in Java and Eclipse. I'm familiar with C/C++, JavaScript, JSP, PL/SQL, Git, Jenkins CI/CD and Jira.
